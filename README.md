Tower of Hanoi is a console application written in .Net. It is a simulation of the classic puzzle, Tower of Hanoi. 

## Starting Menu

When you first launch the application, you are greeted with this menu. You are given a few options, view instructions, play game, or launch the auto solver.

## Playing the Game

When you choose to play the game, you are asked how many blocks/disks you would like to play with. After that, it loads the game and you are ready to start. 
During the game, you are asked two things each round. What post would you like to grab from and where would you like to move it. Every succesful move adds 
to your move count at the bottom. Try to get the least amount of moves possible!

## Auto Solver 

Auto Solver is the last menu option. It is a mode that will solve any puzzle no matter the amount of blocks/disks. When in this mode, it will ask you how many blocks you want. 
It will then ask how many milliseconds should be in between each move. After this it will calculate the estimated time that it will take for the puzzle to be done. This estimate
is not completly accurate because it depends on how powerful your device is. When the Auto Solver is running, it will display how many moves are left, how many seconds have elapsed, 
moves per second, and an estimate of the time remaining. The time remaining on this screen is way more accurate because it takes in account of the moves per second.
